pattern.StringNormalizer sucks.

When too many possible element/attribute names, give only those with
declared namespaces.

Handle wildcards better in possibleContent/possibleAttributes.

Provide matcher interface giving possible values.

Note prefixes used in the schema and use them in qNames in error
messages when no prefix is declared for a namespace.

Use IntersectionNameClassNormalizer in DuplicateAttributeDetector.

Use IntersectionNameClassNormalizer in Alphabet.

Make Matcher available as a property of Validator/ValidatorHandler.  No need for other
ways to get a Matcher.

In ValidatorHandler ignore attributes that are xmlns or xmlns:*.

Support feasible feature for JAXP.

Support check-id-idref feature for JAXP.

Support URIResolver, EntityResolver, Resolver properties for JAXP.

Add JingTask parameter(s) to specify the resolver.

Figure out handling of non-ASCII chars in URIs.

CompactSyntax.jj should check that externalRef and include literal is
a valid Uri.

Transformer in schematron needs a resolver.

Add a target to explicitly run the regex category test.

Reorganize schemas in source tree.

Move test-related .xsl files into mod/*/test.

Move java sources used for testing only into test hierarchy.

Set some more svn:ignore properties; get rid of .cvsignore properties.

test element in mod.xml should specify additional jars.

Merge Jing changes from oNVDL.

Fix bug with not checking "duplicate declaration" and maybe "xsd prefix"
constraint.

Fix bug with empty implicit grammars in compact syntax.

See whether there's a DTDinst bug with a parameter entity containing a
single percent token.

Deal with complaints by XSV about trang's handling of Rahtz's example
(mixed derived from non-mixed).

Handling float/double/Name in trang DTD output module.

Put jing/trang man pages online.

Provide a validate method on Validator so that we can avoid messing
with threads in some cases.

Add doc with hints about how to run jars.

Set Xerces properties to read DTDs but not validate

Option to control DTD parsing

Driver should check for options inappropriate for schema language

Insist that the property
map passed to schema.createValidator contains an error handler or
maybe use DraconianErrorHandler by default.

Maybe rename Validator to ValidationHandlers.

Allow PropertyIds to be used to represent SAX properties/features.
Make use of them in the various SchemaReader implementations.

Move com.thaiopensource.relaxng.util to
com.thaiopensource.validate.driver?

Should have option for specifying non-XML language in a general way.

Compact syntax parser should provide encoding information.

Give a warning for a list containing a single token.

Give a more helpful message for sequence of strings
outside a list.

Handle comments embedded within strings better.

Put location information in error messages into a standard format
understandable by Emacs.

In a big choice or interleave or attribute group, memoization for each
binary pattern is inefficient.

Option to recover from unknown datatype libraries.

Implement ValidationContext.getBaseUri in the instance.

Support infoset modification for ID/IDREF/IDREFS.

Maybe introduce a variant of the element pattern that has a mapping
from names to content models.

Better error message for wrong namespace URI.

Option to be verbose.
