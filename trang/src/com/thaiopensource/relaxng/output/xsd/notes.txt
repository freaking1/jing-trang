Simple fixups:

Attribute name-classes

attribute foo|bar { x } => attribute foo { x } | attribute bar {x }

attribute * - foo|bar)

Obnly ever generate process contents = skip



Deal with single target namespace; only elements with that target namespace;
only attributes with that target namespace or nothing.

Allow elements with empty namespace.



Stage 2

Deal with multiple target namespaces

Split up files based on namespace.


Simple types:

- Deal with multiple pattern params
- Deal with NOTATION somehow
- Sequence turns into list


Contains attributes/text and sometimes referenced as a complexType, then
define as complexType

Sometimes referenced not as a complexType, define as a group
