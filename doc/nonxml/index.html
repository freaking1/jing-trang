<h1>RELAX NG Non-XML Syntax</h1>

<p>I have developed an experimental non-XML syntax for <a
href="http://relaxng.org">RELAX NG</a>. The following are
available:</p>

<ul>

<li>a <a href="syntax.html">description</a> of the syntax</li>

<li>an <a href="relaxng.rnx.txt">example</a> showing a schema for
RELAX NG's XML syntax written in the non-XML syntax (this is optimized
for readability in the non-XML syntax and is not simply a translation
of <code>relaxng.rng</code>)</li>

</ul>

<p>The following tools provide support for the syntax:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="../jing.html">Jing</a> will validate using
the non-XML syntax when the <code>-n</code> option is used</li>

<li><a href="../trang.html">Trang</a> can translate schemas written in
the non-XML syntax; in particular, trang can be used to translate
schemas written in the non-XML syntax into the standard RELAX NG XML
syntax</li>

</ul>

<p>This syntax is not a part of RELAX NG, and is not a product of the
OASIS RELAX NG TC.  However, the OASIS RELAX NG TC have decided to
produce a non-XML syntax for RELAX NG, which I expect to be similar to
this syntax.</p>
